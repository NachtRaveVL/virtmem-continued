docs:
- Describe allocators and virtual pointers
- Locking
- Make and link to examples
- Document allocator classes
- CVirtPtr/CBaseVirtPtr description
- util functions
- check if all references are OK
- Check if example code is OK
- Describe limitations of structs/classes in CVirtPtr
- spell checks
- makeVirtPtrLock()
- highleight the important things and background stuff
- pointers to struct members
- multiple SPI chips also supported

general:
- switch to c++11 code? (template aliasing, removal of NILL?)
- decouple alloc and free static functions from virtual pointer class? Guess it's not really possible
